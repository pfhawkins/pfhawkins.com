                <p>This is the story of a man and his favorite text editor.</p>
<p>In 2001, I was a freshman in college, which meant the closest thing to
highspeed internet that I had hitherto experienced. Which upped my time
surfing the web. One of the delightful sites I lighted upon was
<a href="https://ftrain.com">Ftrain.</a></p>
<p>One day, I dug through Ftrain&rsquo;s archives and found <a href="https://ftrain.com/util_emacs_hints.html">Emacs
Notepad</a>. I was intrigued. Having
exclusively used Word (and Notepad to edit HTML - ha!) up until that point,
this Emacs thingy sounded fascinating. I downloaded a Windows version right
away.</p>
<p>I soon found that the Windows port of Emacs was stuck on version 19, and the
rest of the Emacs-lovin&rsquo; universe was using version 21 on some posix-compliant
operating system. I decided to hope and pray that soon the Emacs developers
would take a little time out to help us poor souls using Windows.</p>
<p>It was a long wait. A long wait in which <em>I could not get LaTeX to work</em>. So
long, in fact, that the next fall, with the aid of a new dorm-mate, I dual-
booted Red Hat 9 Linux.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great about Emacs, and about free software in general, is that I have
as much control as I desire over my computer. I haven&rsquo;t taken the time to
install Linux from scratch, but if I wanted to, the tools are there, and there
aren&rsquo;t any proprietary hindrances or DRM snafus to thwart my progress. My
limited ability to understand maths may hinder me, but my software isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So actually, I am indebted to Emacs for not only making my computing life much
easier and more productive, but from freeing me from the limitations of
Microsoft. Although I see I didn&rsquo;t really describe just how it has made my
computing life easier, or more productive. I&rsquo;ll have to remedy that in a
future post.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I never said it was a good story of a man and his favorite text
editor.</p>
