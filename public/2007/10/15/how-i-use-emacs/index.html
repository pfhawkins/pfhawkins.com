                <p>When I started using Emacs, I had grandiose notions of producing copious
amounts of prose, linking it together in all sorts of interesting and helpful
ways, and basically revolutionizing the way I experienced computers. But most
of all, I had a new and urgent desire to do everything from the keyboard in a
blazingly efficient manner.</p>
<p>I proceeded to burn the Emacs keybindings into my brain and fingers. I
developed some slightly inefficient workflows (copying and pasting from text
documents into OpenOffice documents, editing the original text file based on
whatever page length I was going for, rinse and repeat until paper is
produced) that were, on the whole, a net gain due to the speed of typing
without mousing. The linux filesystem positively danced under my fingertips. I
had more control over my system than I had ever had on Windows.</p>
<p>I progressed to producing documents and drafts in LaTeX. While it&rsquo;s a bit
arcane, using Emacs with AUCTeX made writing LaTeX arguably faster (and
certainly prettier) than writing in Microsoft Word. My long-held desire,
though, was to <em>learn a programming language</em> (I chose python) and <em>code my
own Content Management System</em>. Events in meatspace have conspired against me
acheiving that goal up to this point; now I am making progress. I can&rsquo;t
imagine working in any other editor. Oh wait: I can. I switched to vim for
four months earlier this year.</p>
<h3 id="yes-i-tried-vim">Yes, I tried Vim</h3>
<p>You heard me: I tried vim. My main motivation was a bout of Emacs Pinky. My
left pinky occasionally gets sore if I spend too much time on the laptop. At
the time I attributed it to the control sequences that Emacs uses, but now I&rsquo;m
more aware that it&rsquo;s just that my laptop has an inelegant and potentially
harmful keyboard. If I use an ergonomic keyboard with Emacs, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>Vim was fine. It&rsquo;s a great text editor. If you want a powerful text editor,
your two choices are vim and Emacs, and though I prefer Emacs, I won&rsquo;t fault
you for choosing vim. It does some fantabulous things. You can script it in
python, for example. But scripting vim in python feels a <strong>lot</strong> like
scripting Emacs in python; there&rsquo;s a lot of cruft, and it doesn&rsquo;t play well
with the innards of the system like elisp does. And there were all these
little things that I missed.</p>
<h3 id="what-im-doing-with-emacs-now">What I&rsquo;m Doing With Emacs Now</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m evolving into the type of person who tries to do as much as possible
inside Emacs. Here&rsquo;s a partial list of how I use it now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email client</li>
<li>Personal Planner</li>
<li>Coding environment for my as-yet-unfinished CMS</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Writing Fiction</li>
<li>irc</li>
<li>limited web browsing (mostly online APIs for the python libraries I&rsquo;m investigating)</li>
<li>World Domination
Okay, I really haven&rsquo;t used Emacs for world domination yet. But as I was
reading [The Golden Age](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812579844?ie=UTF8&amp;t">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812579844?ie=UTF8&amp;t</a>
ag=phawkcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0812579844),
I was slightly disappointed when he was naming some of the far-future self-
aware AI characters, and Emacs didn&rsquo;t make the list.</li>
