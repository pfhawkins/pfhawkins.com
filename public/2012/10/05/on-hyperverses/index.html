                <p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one of the reasons I never update this blog is
because I don&rsquo;t <em>focus</em> on any particular topic. Some people can dash
off unfocused blog posts at the drop of a hat. I, for good or ill, am
not a member of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">that set</a>.</p>

<p>Back in, oh, April-ish, I found a topic that not only I could obsess
over, but has proven to be an inspiration to write about online. I
started looking into Hypertext with a capital aitch, the idea that
writing with little interlinking bits would revolutionize literature
in unfathomable ways. It was a thing in the 90&rsquo;s, right? Whatever
happened to that?</p>

<p>One thing led to another, and I started a steady diet of reading on
hypermedia APIs, hypertext, and electronic literature. And unlike
other such interests, I kept at it. This one hasn&rsquo;t flagged beyond
reading a book or two. I am up to my armpits in instapaper articles
and PDFs (and I even purchased a couple trade paperbacks) that I not
only plan on reading some day, but am actually working on a reading
list to make sure I cover certain topics. Which sounds like a totally
normal thing to do, but it is far afield from my usual spotty reading
habits.</p>

<p>Given the nature of the topic, I wanted not just to learn the topic,
but create within the constraints of the topic. And while octopress is
a fine blogging platform, I did not want to dash off a blog. I wanted
to craft a site. Which meant I&rsquo;ve spent more time than I probably
ought to have diving into free font sites and learning CSS and Sass
and ultimately <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>.</p>

<p>And then I managed to squeak out what you see at <a href="http://www.hypervers.es">Hyperverses</a>.</p>

<p>While eventually (one of these days!) my coding chops will be almost
good enough to get across to the computer what my brain wants to do,
right now I generate a static site using Middleman. Which is classic
hypertext. It&rsquo;s a step up from writing my own HTML, to be sure. But
it&rsquo;s not as easy as blogging. I have to rewrite the site config every
time I build the site just to make sure the index page consists of the
new piece I&rsquo;ve written. The CSS is atrocious, I bet the HTML is
nonstandard. There is a good deal wrong with this site. But.</p>

<p>Since my focus is on hypertext, I wanted text to play a prominent role
in the design. I had designed a pretty decent typographic logo for a
header. It didn&rsquo;t sit well. Finally I just ended up putting the site
name as a straight typed logo for the site. It still didn&rsquo;t set well
on top, so I moved it and a lot of the boring site navigation stuff
down in the footer.</p>

<p>The drawback to the approach I&rsquo;ve taken is that while I&rsquo;m happy with
how the design has turned out, the architecture behind the site is not
as &ldquo;hypermedia&rdquo; as I had originally envisioned. But at least now I
have a spot to write about it.</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://www.hypervers.es">the site</a> so I could spare the
less than tens of numbers of readers of this blog endless diatribes on
whatever literary or RESTful topic popped into my brain. Yet I did not
write. Partly because my personal life has been busy, but mostly
because I didn&rsquo;t have a toolchain for the type of site I wanted to
build until I discovered Middleman. And even then, I&rsquo;m not sure how
long middleman will be around. So it serves my purpose for now.</p>

<p>Normally in the past if I&rsquo;d encountered the obstacle of not being able
to write about the thing I really really wanted to write about right
then, I&rsquo;d have given up. But instead I got my feet wet by creating a
twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/hyperverses">@hyperverses</a>. And I
got hooked with that, doing research and finding new things to read
and occasionally making a point of my own.</p>

<p>The site only has one page. I will be adding more soon. The footer
almost certainly will be expanding in scope. I&rsquo;ve started tagging the
pages within middleman but I have no idea if I&rsquo;ll ever use the tags.
But it&rsquo;s a start, and I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
