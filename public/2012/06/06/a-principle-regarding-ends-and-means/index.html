                <p>Okay, listen up. This is pretty simple. I&rsquo;m gonna start by defining terms.</p>
<p><em>Ends</em> are goals. If you take action, you usually do so to accomplish an end. Say, if I go buy bread and deli meat, I do so in order to accomplish the end of eating a sandwich.</p>
<p><em>Means</em> are the steps you go through to accomplish an end. So, in the sandwich example, purchasing bread and deli meat, putting a few slices of meat on the bread, getting a knife out and slathering one of the bread slices with mayo: all these are means to the end of ultimately eating the sandwich.</p>
<p>For some reason, people don&rsquo;t realize all the implications of what I&rsquo;m about to say:</p>
<p><strong>It is never, NEVER okay to perform evil means in order to accomplish good ends!</strong></p>
<h2 id="but-if-i-go-back-in-time-and-murder-hitler-i-could-save-so-many-jews">But, If I Go Back In Time And Murder Hitler, I Could Save So Many Jews!</h2>
<p>You just might save a bunch of Jews! Saving Jews is good. <strong>Murder is bad.</strong> Guess what? <em>You can&rsquo;t murder!</em> Not without being evil, anyway. And you want to be good, not evil, for fairly obvious reasons I&rsquo;m not going to go into here.</p>
<h2 id="when-ought-i-apply-this-principle">When Ought I Apply This Principle?</h2>
<p>All. The. Time.</p>
<p>Seriously. Any time someone suggests you do anything at all, or if you are considering any course of action, don&rsquo;t just ask yourself &ldquo;is my goal good?&rdquo; Make sure you also ask yourself &ldquo;are all the intermediary steps (that I can conceive of) that I need to take to accomplish my goal themselves good?&rdquo; If even <em>one</em> of those steps is just a <em>little</em> evil, <strong>YOU NEED TO RETHINK THAT GOAL.</strong></p>
<p>If your goal has an immoral mean somewhere, you can rethink it one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace it with a moral mean</li>
<li>abandon that goal</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to be good, those are your only options.</p>
<h2 id="this-seems-hard">This Seems Hard.</h2>
<p>Yes! It&rsquo;s very hard. If you actually try to live this out, you find yourself abandoning goals you would never in your most fevered imaginings dream you&rsquo;d abandon. Giving up evil goals that seem like fun is hard enough; giving up legitimately <em>good</em> goals is much harder. But it is completely and utterly worth it.</p>
