      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>There is no story of consequence to this. I tire of using <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I deal with it at work and it wearies me. So I am trying something new here.</p>
<p>This next iteration of the blog employs <a href="https://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. I may have to update the colophon.</p></p>

        Book Lending
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>I have a new theory of book-lending. I&rsquo;ve always been extremely recalcitrant
to lend out my precious, precious tomes. They are my babies. Letting someone
else read them who certainly doesn&rsquo;t appreciate them to the same degree, or in
the same kind, is a risky proposition.</p>
<p>My current reading pile includes a heaping helping of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_economics">Austrian
Economics</a>. I love this
stuff. A sense of economics on this scale rewires your brain circuitry (what a
crappy, ubiquitous brain-as-turing-machine metaphor) in subtle and not so
subtle ways. It is some of the best non-fiction reading I&rsquo;ve engaged in in
years.</p></p>

        Stupid Simple Bibsonomy to Delicious Migration
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>A while back I switched from <a href="https://delicious.com">delicious</a> to
<a href="https://bibsonomy.org">bibsonomy</a> to handle all my social bookmarking needs. I
was all taken in by the RDF backing. I decided recently to switch back, since
it didn&rsquo;t have the user base and general ecosystem, it&rsquo;s geared toward more
academic pursuits, and RDF isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be. Here&rsquo;s a tarball
of the scripts I used to move the bookmarks back into delicious:</p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>I previously mentioned that I was working on my own custom blog software for
this site. I&rsquo;m not posting as I do so, because if I did, I&rsquo;d end up with
something like <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/archive_ftrainone_919746918.html">this</a>.

        Suckage

      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>The only to write well is to write often and get the kinks out. I don&rsquo;t write
well yet. Therefore, expect to see a fair deal of suckage in this space before
you start to see amazing prose of stunning brilliance. (And then, thank God
that you&rsquo;re only seeing a fraction of what I&rsquo;m actually writing).</p>

        Decisions, decisions
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>I&rsquo;m not just being quiet here, dear hypothetical reader; I&rsquo;m sitting on a
couple of posts, waiting for the perfect time to post them. I realize that
they are going unread just sitting on my hard drive. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m not
confident that they are any good.</p>
<p>One of the posts is the first in a series of posts on authors who choose to
utilize their first and middle initials in public, rather than their full
names. (Thanks to the reality of domain names, and the fact that <a href="https://www.patrickhawkins.net">some
organist</a> beat me to it, I&rsquo;ve decided to go
down this route as well.) Interesting concept for a series, or a complete dud?
Who knows until I actually post?</p></p>

      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>I was going through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684857618?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=phawkcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0684857618">The Word Museum: The Most Remarkable English Words Ever Forgotten</a> and I found this
complete gem of a word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extramundane: the infinite empty space, which is by some supposed to be
extended beyond the bounds of the universe, and in which there is nothing at
all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is very near what I would call a perfect word. As is this other one I
found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stellascript: That which is written in the stars.</p></p>

        First Post
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Welcome to pfhawkins.com!</p>
<p>My name is P.F. Hawkins. I have a first name and a middle name of which I am
not ashamed (unlike Clive Staples Lewis or Pelham Grenville Wodehouse), but my
first name/last name combination was not available as a domain name, so I
thought I would imitate them in using my first two initials.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t decided whether or not I am going to use this site as a serious,
work-related sort of site for freelancing (I might start copywriting on the
side), or if I&rsquo;m going to ignore all that and go with my life-long dream of
becoming a published novelist. Probably the latter. Hopefully after doing this
for a few months, the site will take on a life of its own. But in the
meantime, feel free to stick around and watch me thrash about whilst I find my
voice.</p></p>
