      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>The wordsmithy raided the vowel-shed<br>
For a round &ldquo;O&rdquo; to hold up surrounding consonants.<br>
In the smithy he realized that alone it could not hold the &ldquo;R&rdquo; and &ldquo;T&rdquo; together,<br>
But he always kept a few &ldquo;E&rdquo; at the workbench.</p>
<p>In two short decades he found his job obsoleted by script kiddies crawling the fourth channel,<br>
RSI brain cramps birthing automated skynet.</p></p>

        Grass Demons
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Black twisted gnarled gristle<br>
Lawn dance and howl whistle<br>
Spew out the fire bile<br>
Hate-wracked the whole while<br>
Teeth gnawing blood-glistened<br>
No time to love-listen.<br>
Can&rsquo;t rue the damned day<br>
Eternity&rsquo;s the same way<br>
Dance down the death-glade<br>
Empty with heart spayed.<br>
What&rsquo;s left is tied taut;<br>
Pain fills the no-thought.<br>
What was the self thing,<br>
Clutched, did this hell bring?</p></p>

        Dank
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>He drove into the dark night<br>
That street lamps barely beat back with bleak light.<br>
The spastic highway loomed languid, leapt aside,<br>
Bowed down before the doomed ride<br>
As he barrelled toward his dead bride,<br>
Seeking pitch to patch the gape in his side.</p></p>

        Hell, or Something Like It

      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Darksomeness engulfs<br>
Low fallow fields left<br>
Firm as rock dried in sun,<br>
Cold as crisp iceberg submerged.</p>
<p>Submariners stumble on<br>
Unseen fissues, folds,<br>
Crevasses, barren blisters<br>
Of lifeless locked land.</p>
<p>Passengers punched their tickets,<br>
Paid their fares, folded<br>
Clothes, packed bags, braved<br>
Jet lag just to be here.</p>
<p>Groping in obsidian night, all<br>
Rend asunder suddenly, then<br>
Rend again, rend again,<br>
Ever tearing never ending</p>
<p>Souls unbending, breaking o&rsquo;er<br>
And o&rsquo;er again in pain<br>
Unmending, sending lame<br>
Desires (unquenched fires) drowning.</p></p>

        Talkies

      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>stars scream heavy metal silver screen<br>
heart strings tugged taut ripped clean<br>
death dealt down to damn mean<br>
man brought through no more green<br>
played for laughs aged thirteen<br>
main stream man&rsquo;s a sad scene</p></p>

        Entropy Lament
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>In the morning as I brushed my teeth<br>
I vowed to mark the day by valiant ways:<br>
To rescue orphans, open up a shop,<br>
Write that novel, win that maiden&rsquo;s heart,<br>
Climb that hill, convince a bitter friend<br>
Of God&rsquo;s wide mercy, till the soil, plant<br>
The choicest vegetables, grill meat<br>
Upon an open flame. In short,<br>
Engage in derring-do,<br>
And leave upon the earth a healthy brand.</p>
<p>Instead I shuffled off toward my job<br>
(leeching little life from radio&rsquo;s wiles),<br>
Sat in my cubicle, answered emails,<br>
Took calls, called shots, most of which were small,<br>
Mundane, of little consequence. And while<br>
I always tried to do my best, at end<br>
Of day I&rsquo;d lost so much to waste,<br>
My puny fight &lsquo;gainst entropy unwon,<br>
And still to lose. I shuffled home, then<br>
Microwaved some food, watched video,<br>
Paid homage to the goods that fence me in<br>
And hinder me from seeing the sublime<br>
In humble living, mastery of self,<br>
Right conduct, purity of heart,<br>
And noble deed. Indulged on, fat<br>
And restless, I hied myself to bed<br>
So I could rest to do it all again,<br>
And leave yet more undone.</p></p>

        Goodbye Follies
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>The tree-struck star stuck the landing,<br>
Knees nailed to ground, brow down,<br>
Soul still ensconced in briar crown.</p>
<p>Apart from Him he&rsquo;d hewn to<br>
Aspirations, plans He&rsquo;d blewn to<br>
Smithereens; and left bereft he<br>
Clung to holy barque.</p></p>

        Tuesday Juggernaut
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Sitting on the curb by the park bench<br>
Barefoot listen to the buzz growl<br>
Motors on the tires on the asphalt on the feet<br>
What a sandwich, what a sandwich<br>
Now God don&rsquo;t exist but oh! this sandwich<br>
Slave to the toil for the belly, the hunger<br>
Wish I was slave for the love of another<br>
We born let to die and then, my brother<br>
The poet look cockeyed at whistling trees<br>
He call me a trickster, I ask &ldquo;Who art thee?<br>
Are you of this world or are you born free?<br>
This concrete jungle, what&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;<br>
That sandwich was tasty I wish I had pie<br>
If that&rsquo;s all there is then it&rsquo;s all been a lie<br>
Scatterbrain scatterbrain eat, poop, die</p></p>

        When Love Attacks
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Love lies crouched on haunches,<br>
Coiled prehensile set to spring<br>
Unsuspecting upon prey.</p>
<p>In the proper hour Love leaps,<br>
Thrusting self through myocardial tissue,<br>
Dissolving as a tear gas in the bloodstream.</p></p>

        Spaceman In Space
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Hurtling slowly through the void<br>
Floating about in a flight suit<br>
Checking, rechecking the ship&rsquo;s math<br>
Occasionally putting the helmet on</p>
<p>There are lots of checklists in space</p>
<p>The ship always beats him at chess</p>
<p>He never watches films anymore.<br>
He never reads novels anymore.<br>
Sometimes he cranks up the music,<br>
And sometimes he drifts in the silence.</p>
<p>When he can&rsquo;t sleep, he remembers when he used to dance the tango.</p></p>

        The Cubicle Men
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Wage servants sit glued to the glowing<br>
Of the monitors, manipulating<br>
Electrons of Industry.</p>
<p>Inside, spleen gives way to toxins<br>
Untouched by liver, imbibed<br>
After terms of indenture.</p>
<p>In deeper, indivisible selves wither,<br>
Except for the few that forge fearsomeness there.</p></p>

        Only the Things that are Dead are Electric
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>In the realm of Whimsy everything&rsquo;s verdant:<br>
Centaurs at leisure braid each other&rsquo;s hair.<br>
Ogres belch as they work on their cross-stitch.<br>
Weeping willow branches sparkle like wind-chimes.<br>
Knights take care not to trample on butterflies,<br>
Lest the King be unable to brew his tea.<br>
Unsurprisingly, mimes have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Velveteen unicorns eat day-glo batteries,<br>
Drink carbonated rainbows.<br>
On Thursdays the King distributes gold stars<br>
To everyone who has achieved.</p></p>

        On Death

      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>Vile split of self from same,<br>
Extinguishing of vital flame;<br>
Halfway there is merely maim.</p>
<p>In factories and bathroom stalls,<br>
Farmer&rsquo;s fields and city halls,<br>
This interloper all men calls.</p></p>

All round the spinning plate,<br>
In the Mathematic place;</p>
<p>Objects soon instantiate;<br>

Computation filled with grace.<br>

Hurtling down the intertubes<br>
Captioning photos of felines in bold sans serif<br>
cuteness aplenty, lolling all over myself<br>
Eager to disprove or win by force your momma, mah bukkit, bukkake<br>
Full of fail</p>
<p>Let us read <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU">this treatise on the death star</a>, how it is like unto a womb.</p>
<p>THIS POEM HAS BEEN RICK-ROLLED</p>
