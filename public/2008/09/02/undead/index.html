                <p>&ldquo;Un-&rdquo; is a negative prefix denoting the opposite of the word to which it is
affixed. The nearest equivalent prefix is &ldquo;non-&rdquo;, which denotes the same
thing. &ldquo;Un-&rdquo;, however, also possesses a connotation (in many applications of
the prefix) of time, where previously the state or thing that is not, once
was.</p>
<p>In the case of zombies, the term &ldquo;undead&rdquo; is used to refer to them as a
collective whole, as a race or species. &ldquo;Nondead&rdquo; is less appropriate, for
while it would convey the fact that zombies are far more ambulatory than the
normative deceased, it fails to convey that the zombies were once dead; or, if
it does convey that, it does so with much less force.</p>
<p>(Another example of this connotation, although one based in marketing rather
than in organic etymology, holds for &ldquo;uncola&rdquo;; 7up has always been a
carbonated sweet water, and therefore <em>a</em> cola, although it subverts the usual
formulae for what is deemed as cola, and in so doing is perceived [due to
intensive advertising more than anything] as having progressed from a state of
being cola to a state of being <strong>beyond</strong> cola.)</p>
<p>The utility of the &ldquo;un-&rdquo; prefix used in this manner cannot be overstated. For
clearly, the undead, while no longer deceased, also are no longer living. The
simple addition of this prefix drums up a word for a third state of being.</p>
