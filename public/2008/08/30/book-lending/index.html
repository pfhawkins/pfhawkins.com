                <p>I have a new theory of book-lending. I&rsquo;ve always been extremely recalcitrant
to lend out my precious, precious tomes. They are my babies. Letting someone
else read them who certainly doesn&rsquo;t appreciate them to the same degree, or in
the same kind, is a risky proposition.</p>
<p>My current reading pile includes a heaping helping of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_economics">Austrian
Economics</a>. I love this
stuff. A sense of economics on this scale rewires your brain circuitry (what a
crappy, ubiquitous brain-as-turing-machine metaphor) in subtle and not so
subtle ways. It is some of the best non-fiction reading I&rsquo;ve engaged in in
years.</p>
<p>I have to lend these books out. I simply must. I&rsquo;ve attempted to get others
interested in them, with a little success. My brother, who is reliabel in
returning books I&rsquo;ve lent him unread, raved about Ron Paul&rsquo;s [The Revolution:
A Manifesto](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%252">https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2</a>

about lending out other sacred cows; after the Watchmen trailer hit the web I
lent [my copy](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A">https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A</a>

<p>The realization, which has been slow in coming, dawns that I&rsquo;ve read book X
once, and the odds of me rereading it in the next few years are pretty slim. I
can, therefore, safely risk the copy into the hand of others, where they can
better and more frequently fulfill their functions as books. A book is at its
best when its being read, when a man is bending his soul to the shape of
another&rsquo;s thought. The more capital I can pump into the marketplace of
thought, the better served the consumers of that capital; not humanity, but
flesh-and-blood humans. I&rsquo;ve a couple books, mostly reference, that others can
read only in the confines of my abode, but they are now the exception rather
than the rule.</p>
