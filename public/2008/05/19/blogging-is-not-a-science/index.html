                <p>There is something about data that recommends itself. The more data you have
the more you ostensibly know about the subject; the more you know the better
basis you have for your decisions; the better foundation for your decisions
the higher the odds your decisions are the right ones. Everyone likes to make
the right decisions. Few things are as truly satisfying.</p>
<p>That said, most data are crap. If they&rsquo;re not inaccurate then they draw your
focus to the wrong thing. Instead of basing your decisions on what it is
you&rsquo;re actually doing, you&rsquo;re basing them on a reading of the effects they had
the last time you did them.</p>
<p>The above is exemplified in web statistics. Say, for example, that you start
blogging. You&rsquo;re shouting into the void on a regular basis, and then BAM!
<a href="https://sachachua.com/wp/2007/10/12/how-i-came-to-love-emacs/">someone links</a>
to [one of your pieces](<a href="https://pfhawkins.com/2007/10/10/how-i-came-to-love-">https://pfhawkins.com/2007/10/10/how-i-came-to-love-</a>
emacs/), and you watch your stats shoot up. The tempting thing to do is write
a <a href="https://pfhawkins.com/2007/10/15/how-i-use-emacs/">similar piece</a> on the
same topic. AND YOU WOULD BE WRONG.</p>
<p>What worked the first time? Writing something you wanted to write for the sake
of writing it. The second time, your ulterior, utilitarian motives will work
against you.</p>
<p>I was spurred to write this by <a href="https://twitter.com/al3x/statuses/812166550">this
tweet</a>, with which I completely
agree. On the one hand, blogging is a conversation. On the other, it is
shouting into the void. There are no guarantees that anyone will click your
way, or read what you&rsquo;ve written once they get there. And if <a href="https://twitter.com/ronaldlewis/statuses/310321802">that&rsquo;s your
focus</a>, well, maybe you&rsquo;ll
get the links, but you&rsquo;ll have sold out. I&rsquo;m not condemning selling out, it
has its time and place, but there is a reason people sneer when they say &ldquo;he
sold out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting my money where my mouth is: goodbye Google Analytics. Goodbye
data. If you need me, <a href="https://pfhawkins.com/contact/">email works best</a>.</p>
