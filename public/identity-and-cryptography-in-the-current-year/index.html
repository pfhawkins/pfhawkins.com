                <p>I&rsquo;ve got about three different lead-ins to this post rattling around my head.
There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have flying cars, but we have public-key cryptography
that isn&rsquo;t completely terrible&rdquo; angle. There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;truly we are living
in a William Gibson novel&rdquo; angle. But I think I&rsquo;ll take the &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a true story
about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>
is being used right this second&rdquo; angle.
Everybody loves a good anecdote, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this fellow by the name of <a href="https://keybase.io/microchip">Michael Anderson</a>.
Big alt-right Trump
supporter type. He tends to approach Twitter the way Leroy Jenkins approaches
WoW raids: big, loud, and in a way that aggravates a large number of the party.
Mr. Anderson has had his account banned repeatedly, both before and after Twitter&rsquo;s
recent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/11/17/twitter-suspends-several-accounts-in-alt-right-purge.html">purges of alt-right accounts</a>.
But every time his account is suspended for good, he makes a new account and keeps
on trucking.</p>
<p>If you or I had to start a new twitter account, it would take us quite a while
to get the word out that the new account is actually a replacement for the old
account. It would likely take
months to regain just a fraction of the followers. If Twitter didn&rsquo;t grace us
with a blue check mark, some would be skeptical that the new account was ours.
But MicroTurkeyLeaks&rsquo; few thousand followers
are able to easily find his latest account, even though he&rsquo;s cycled
through as many as three accounts in a <em>single day</em>. And what&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;re
almost positive it&rsquo;s his, even without a blue checkmark.</p>
<p>How does he manage this impressive feat? <a href="https://keybase.io">keybase.io</a>.</p>
<p>Keybase describes itself thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keybase maps your identity to your public keys, and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditional use of PGP (the most popular form of public-key cryptography)
requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party">key-signing parties</a>
in real life in order for people to vouch for each other&rsquo;s PGP identities.
Keybase uses less direct methods of verification. I don&rsquo;t wish to get into the
nitty gritty of cryptographic signing here, but once you have a PGP public key
in keybase&rsquo;s system, you can then sign proofs on various social media accounts,
as well as any websites you run. Others <a href="https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/following">can then review and sign off on those
proofs</a>, building a web of
trust much more easily than with straight PGP.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a <a href="https://keybase.io/pfhawkins">keybase profile for P.F. Hawkins</a>.
I cannot stress enough that not only has much thought been put into the system,
but it&rsquo;s been the <em>right</em> thought. The process was streamlined, the UX intuitive,
the copy understandable and engaging… I&rsquo;ll stop gushing over it sometime, I
suppose, but only when it (or a system like it) becomes <em>de rigueur</em>.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have flying cars, but we now have non-terrible public-key cryptography.
Truly we are living in a William Gibson novel.</p>
