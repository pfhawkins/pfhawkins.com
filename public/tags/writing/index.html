        On Finding a Document Production Workflow for Emacs
      </a>
      <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>I have a modest goal: write some fiction. Instead of actually working toward
accomplishing that goal, I&rsquo;m going to obsess about the toolchain and other
externalities used to support this endeavor.</p>
<p>I will use revision control. By an accident of history I will be using git.</p>
<p>I will use a text editor. Since I don&rsquo;t want to have to run into frictions
from modal editing while fiction writing, I will be using Emacs.</p></p>

        Thoughts Writers Have
      </a>
      <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>I could really go for a smoke. I&rsquo;m a non-smoker. The most I ever smoked was
three times in one kinda stressful week in college. And I try to buy the good
stuff when I do. No Camels for me.</p>
<p>If I ever want a smoke, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve an itch that needs scratching, and a
cigarette seems like the shortest path to itch relief. It never is though.
There&rsquo;s a deeper underlying reason why I have dry skin. The itching won&rsquo;t
abate until I eat my vitamins, or eat animal fats, or stop eating melons, or
get new genes. The rest is vapid style.</p></p>

        How I Use Emacs
      </a>
      <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>When I started using Emacs, I had grandiose notions of producing copious
amounts of prose, linking it together in all sorts of interesting and helpful
ways, and basically revolutionizing the way I experienced computers. But most
of all, I had a new and urgent desire to do everything from the keyboard in a
blazingly efficient manner.</p>
<p>I proceeded to burn the Emacs keybindings into my brain and fingers. I
developed some slightly inefficient workflows (copying and pasting from text
documents into OpenOffice documents, editing the original text file based on
whatever page length I was going for, rinse and repeat until paper is
produced) that were, on the whole, a net gain due to the speed of typing
without mousing. The linux filesystem positively danced under my fingertips. I
had more control over my system than I had ever had on Windows.</p></p>
