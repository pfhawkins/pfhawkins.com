<h2 id="on-mixel">On Mixel</h2>
<p><a href="https://mixel.cc" title="Mixel">Mixel</a> confounds me as a piece of software that shines so brightly, the shadows of its flaws are made proportionately more apparent.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mixel/yeti.jpg" alt="A Yeti walks in the snowy woods"></p>
<p>Mixel is an iPad app for making collages that has the whole &ldquo;social networking&rdquo; thing baked into its DNA.</p>
<p>Making a collage feels like something the iPad was <em>born</em> to do. Swipe swipe, swipe swipe, tap, swipe, BOOM! ART! I am not an artist by training or temperament, although I do doodle extensively in the margins of my notebooks. Using a pile of raw ingredients and the few methods mixel provides for manipulating them, I can create something that, if it isn&rsquo;t art, looks and feels like &ldquo;art&rdquo;.</p></p>

        How I Came to Love Emacs
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>This is the story of a man and his favorite text editor.</p>
<p>In 2001, I was a freshman in college, which meant the closest thing to
highspeed internet that I had hitherto experienced. Which upped my time
surfing the web. One of the delightful sites I lighted upon was
<a href="https://ftrain.com">Ftrain.</a></p>
<p>One day, I dug through Ftrain&rsquo;s archives and found <a href="https://ftrain.com/util_emacs_hints.html">Emacs
Notepad</a>. I was intrigued. Having
exclusively used Word (and Notepad to edit HTML - ha!) up until that point,
this Emacs thingy sounded fascinating. I downloaded a Windows version right
away.</p></p>
