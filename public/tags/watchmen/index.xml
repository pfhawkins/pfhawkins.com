      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a new theory of book-lending. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been extremely recalcitrant
to lend out my precious, precious tomes. They are my babies. Letting someone
else read them who certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate them to the same degree, or in
the same kind, is a risky proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current reading pile includes a heaping helping of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_economics&#34;&gt;Austrian
Economics&lt;/a&gt;. I love this
stuff. A sense of economics on this scale rewires your brain circuitry (what a
crappy, ubiquitous brain-as-turing-machine metaphor) in subtle and not so
subtle ways. It is some of the best non-fiction reading I&amp;rsquo;ve engaged in in
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to lend these books out. I simply must. I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to get others
interested in them, with a little success. My brother, who is reliabel in
returning books I&amp;rsquo;ve lent him unread, raved about Ron Paul&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2

A Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, which got me started on this kick. I&amp;rsquo;ll next lend him

com-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&#34;&gt;Economics in One Lesson&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hazlitt&#34;&gt;Henry
Hazlitt&lt;/a&gt;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten better
about lending out other sacred cows; after the Watchmen trailer hit the web I
lent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A

eative=9325&#34;&gt;my copy&lt;/a&gt; to a friend at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization, which has been slow in coming, dawns that I&amp;rsquo;ve read book X
once, and the odds of me rereading it in the next few years are pretty slim. I
can, therefore, safely risk the copy into the hand of others, where they can
better and more frequently fulfill their functions as books. A book is at its
best when its being read, when a man is bending his soul to the shape of
another&amp;rsquo;s thought. The more capital I can pump into the marketplace of
thought, the better served the consumers of that capital; not humanity, but
flesh-and-blood humans. I&amp;rsquo;ve a couple books, mostly reference, that others can
read only in the confines of my abode, but they are now the exception rather
than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
