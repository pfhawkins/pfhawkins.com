        Review: Nova by Samuel Delany
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>[Nova](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375706704?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=phawkcom-20&amp;lin">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375706704?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=phawkcom-20&amp;lin</a>
kCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375706704)![](https://www
.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=phawkcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0375706704) is a gem of a
novel. If you can get past one huge <em>faux pas</em>, any sf buff with half a brain
should find something to enjoy in this book.</p>
<p><em>Nova</em> is primarily a space opera. If you don&rsquo;t like space opera, don&rsquo;t worry,
the book is more than just space opera. It is a thoughtful extrapolation of
the future (well, except for the <em>faux pas</em>), as well as a philosophical mind-
twister. But it is primarily a space opera.</p></p>

        Review: Doomsday Book
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>I just finished reading Connie Willis&rsquo;s [Doomsday Book](<a href="https://www.amazon.com/">https://www.amazon.com/</a>
gp/product/0553562738?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=phawkcom-20&amp;linkCodeas2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9
325&amp;creativeASIN=0553562738). Let me just say that I am significantly less
than whelmed. If there&rsquo;s a bar here, about yay high, and it&rsquo;s got &ldquo;Whelmed&rdquo;
written on it in big block letters, this book is significantly under the bar.</p>
<p>Now I understand why it is a popular book. It is conventional. Very few, if
any, science fiction tropes are involved at all (aside from some cutesie
names, such as &ldquo;vids&rdquo; for &ldquo;movies&rdquo;, all phone calls are videophone calls
[although none of those are cellphone calls; the book was written in the
painfully early nineties, so it gets a pass on that one], and time travel).
The drama of the story is in efforts of the two protagonists, Kivrin in the
1300s and Dunworthy in the 2050s, trying to get Kivrin out of the plague. But
the drama is conventional drama. There is no sensawonder here. Which would be
fine, if there were some Weighty Concepts of Great Literature being explored
here. But there&rsquo;s none of those either. Here&rsquo;s what I would consider the
themes of the book (if I was forced to by an English Teacher with a weapon of
some sort):</p></p>
