            On Hyperverses
          </a>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that one of the reasons I never update this blog is
because I don&rsquo;t <em>focus</em> on any particular topic. Some people can dash
off unfocused blog posts at the drop of a hat. I, for good or ill, am
not a member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">that set</a>.</p>
<p>Back in, oh, April-ish, I found a topic that not only I could obsess
over, but has proven to be an inspiration to write about online. I
started looking into Hypertext with a capital aitch, the idea that
writing with little interlinking bits would revolutionize literature
in unfathomable ways. It was a thing in the 90&rsquo;s, right? Whatever
happened to that?</p></p>

            Some Thoughts on The Dark Knight
          </a>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>I went and saw the Dark Knight again. This time I went with my parents. My mom
is a pretty devout woman with a decent artistic sensibility. Afterward she was
still trying to process the experience, and it was good to get her take on
things.</p>
<p>One thing she said that struck me: &ldquo;Everyone says it&rsquo;s lots darker than Batman
Begins. I hate that. It&rsquo;s not dark, it&rsquo;s sadistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one sense, she&rsquo;s right. It is sadistic. But the sense in which she&rsquo;s right
is incomplete. The <em>Joker</em> is sadistic, not the film. He is a twisted sadist
whose mere presence should have given the film an R rating. But the film
doesn&rsquo;t glorify that evil, it <em>exposes</em> it. It presents a glimmer of hope and
a dash of martyrdom in the face of such evil.</p></p>

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>This essay on reading is captioned by the editor &ldquo;An attack on the growing
pretentiousness of American literary prose&rdquo;. And boy howdy!</p>
