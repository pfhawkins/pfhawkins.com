      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Un-&amp;rdquo; is a negative prefix denoting the opposite of the word to which it is&#xA;affixed. The nearest equivalent prefix is &amp;ldquo;non-&amp;rdquo;, which denotes the same&#xA;thing. &amp;ldquo;Un-&amp;rdquo;, however, also possesses a connotation (in many applications of&#xA;the prefix) of time, where previously the state or thing that is not, once&#xA;was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of zombies, the term &amp;ldquo;undead&amp;rdquo; is used to refer to them as a&#xA;collective whole, as a race or species. &amp;ldquo;Nondead&amp;rdquo; is less appropriate, for&#xA;while it would convey the fact that zombies are far more ambulatory than the&#xA;normative deceased, it fails to convey that the zombies were once dead; or, if&#xA;it does convey that, it does so with much less force.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
