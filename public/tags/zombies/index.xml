      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re too funny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why? What did I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was laughing too hard to be taken aback. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo; Snort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I was &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; funny, then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;just the right amount&lt;/em&gt; of funny. When
did I cross the line?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her hysterics subsided. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&amp;rdquo; She instinctively reached for his
hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I simply showed you the comic, which I thought was simply funny, and then
reiterated that I like the man in the last panel would be thinking about how
the bear might defend himself from&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She interrupted. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ll kill it,&amp;rdquo; she said, her face drawing down into
a pout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I thought I did kill it; I went too far.&amp;rdquo; He very nearly looked her full
in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now you have.&amp;rdquo; She actively avoided his stare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I hadn&amp;rsquo;t before?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was laughing my fool head off!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But you said I was &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; funny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God!&amp;rdquo; she blasphemed loudly enough for other passengers to hear. &amp;ldquo;Did you not
catch the emphasis you just repeated back to me? You&amp;rsquo;re too funny doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean
you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;excessively&lt;/em&gt; funny, just that I find you &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; funny.&amp;rdquo; She lightly
punched him in the should; he was oblivious to it. He was too busy thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; he said after a while. &amp;ldquo;I think I blew it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; She was looking straight ahead. &amp;ldquo;Yes you did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I suppose now isn&amp;rsquo;t the time to talk about marriage then.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I suppose not,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I thought we were going to have a nice discussion
about it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On a bus? Because I showed you a comic strip?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why on earth must you always do this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One minute you&amp;rsquo;re hilarious and then you&amp;rsquo;re still huggable but then you&amp;rsquo;re
still so serious about everything it just&amp;hellip; you eat moments like zombies eat
brains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unthinkingly?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She burst out laughing and whacked his chest with her purse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Undead</title>
      <link>http://pfhawkins.com/2008/09/02/undead/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Un-&amp;rdquo; is a negative prefix denoting the opposite of the word to which it is
affixed. The nearest equivalent prefix is &amp;ldquo;non-&amp;rdquo;, which denotes the same
thing. &amp;ldquo;Un-&amp;rdquo;, however, also possesses a connotation (in many applications of
the prefix) of time, where previously the state or thing that is not, once
was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of zombies, the term &amp;ldquo;undead&amp;rdquo; is used to refer to them as a
collective whole, as a race or species. &amp;ldquo;Nondead&amp;rdquo; is less appropriate, for
while it would convey the fact that zombies are far more ambulatory than the
normative deceased, it fails to convey that the zombies were once dead; or, if
it does convey that, it does so with much less force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Another example of this connotation, although one based in marketing rather
than in organic etymology, holds for &amp;ldquo;uncola&amp;rdquo;; 7up has always been a
carbonated sweet water, and therefore &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; cola, although it subverts the usual
formulae for what is deemed as cola, and in so doing is perceived [due to
intensive advertising more than anything] as having progressed from a state of
being cola to a state of being &lt;strong&gt;beyond&lt;/strong&gt; cola.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utility of the &amp;ldquo;un-&amp;rdquo; prefix used in this manner cannot be overstated. For
clearly, the undead, while no longer deceased, also are no longer living. The
simple addition of this prefix drums up a word for a third state of being.&lt;/p&gt;
