<p>&ldquo;Why? What did I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was laughing too hard to be taken aback. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Snort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was <em>too</em> funny, then I wasn&rsquo;t <em>just the right amount</em> of funny. When
did I cross the line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hysterics subsided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; She instinctively reached for his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply showed you the comic, which I thought was simply funny, and then
reiterated that I like the man in the last panel would be thinking about how
the bear might defend himself from&hellip;&rdquo;</p></p>

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>&ldquo;Un-&rdquo; is a negative prefix denoting the opposite of the word to which it is
affixed. The nearest equivalent prefix is &ldquo;non-&rdquo;, which denotes the same
thing. &ldquo;Un-&rdquo;, however, also possesses a connotation (in many applications of
the prefix) of time, where previously the state or thing that is not, once
was.</p>
<p>In the case of zombies, the term &ldquo;undead&rdquo; is used to refer to them as a
collective whole, as a race or species. &ldquo;Nondead&rdquo; is less appropriate, for
while it would convey the fact that zombies are far more ambulatory than the
normative deceased, it fails to convey that the zombies were once dead; or, if
it does convey that, it does so with much less force.</p></p>
