<p>&ldquo;Why? What did I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was laughing too hard to be taken aback. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Snort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was <em>too</em> funny, then I wasn&rsquo;t <em>just the right amount</em> of funny. When
did I cross the line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hysterics subsided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; She instinctively reached for his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply showed you the comic, which I thought was simply funny, and then
reiterated that I like the man in the last panel would be thinking about how
the bear might defend himself from&hellip;&rdquo;</p></p>

            Some Thoughts on The Dark Knight
          </a>
          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>I went and saw the Dark Knight again. This time I went with my parents. My mom
is a pretty devout woman with a decent artistic sensibility. Afterward she was
still trying to process the experience, and it was good to get her take on
things.</p>
<p>One thing she said that struck me: &ldquo;Everyone says it&rsquo;s lots darker than Batman
Begins. I hate that. It&rsquo;s not dark, it&rsquo;s sadistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one sense, she&rsquo;s right. It is sadistic. But the sense in which she&rsquo;s right
is incomplete. The <em>Joker</em> is sadistic, not the film. He is a twisted sadist
whose mere presence should have given the film an R rating. But the film
doesn&rsquo;t glorify that evil, it <em>exposes</em> it. It presents a glimmer of hope and
a dash of martyrdom in the face of such evil.</p></p>
