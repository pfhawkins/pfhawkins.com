      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is something about data that recommends itself. The more data you have&#xA;the more you ostensibly know about the subject; the more you know the better&#xA;basis you have for your decisions; the better foundation for your decisions&#xA;the higher the odds your decisions are the right ones. Everyone likes to make&#xA;the right decisions. Few things are as truly satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, most data are crap. If they&amp;rsquo;re not inaccurate then they draw your&#xA;focus to the wrong thing. Instead of basing your decisions on what it is&#xA;you&amp;rsquo;re actually doing, you&amp;rsquo;re basing them on a reading of the effects they had&#xA;the last time you did them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
