<p>This next iteration of the blog employs <a href="https://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. I may have to update the colophon.</p></p>

something like <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/archive_ftrainone_919746918.html">this</a>.

well yet. Therefore, expect to see a fair deal of suckage in this space before
you start to see amazing prose of stunning brilliance. (And then, thank God
that you&rsquo;re only seeing a fraction of what I&rsquo;m actually writing).</p>

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>I&rsquo;m not just being quiet here, dear hypothetical reader; I&rsquo;m sitting on a
couple of posts, waiting for the perfect time to post them. I realize that
they are going unread just sitting on my hard drive. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m not
confident that they are any good.</p>
<p>One of the posts is the first in a series of posts on authors who choose to
utilize their first and middle initials in public, rather than their full
names. (Thanks to the reality of domain names, and the fact that <a href="https://www.patrickhawkins.net">some
organist</a> beat me to it, I&rsquo;ve decided to go
down this route as well.) Interesting concept for a series, or a complete dud?
Who knows until I actually post?</p></p>

            First Post

          <p class="text-sm md:text-base"><p>Welcome to pfhawkins.com!</p>
<p>My name is P.F. Hawkins. I have a first name and a middle name of which I am
not ashamed (unlike Clive Staples Lewis or Pelham Grenville Wodehouse), but my
first name/last name combination was not available as a domain name, so I
thought I would imitate them in using my first two initials.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t decided whether or not I am going to use this site as a serious,
work-related sort of site for freelancing (I might start copywriting on the
side), or if I&rsquo;m going to ignore all that and go with my life-long dream of
becoming a published novelist. Probably the latter. Hopefully after doing this
for a few months, the site will take on a life of its own. But in the
meantime, feel free to stick around and watch me thrash about whilst I find my
voice.</p></p>
