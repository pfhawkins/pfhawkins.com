        Entropy Lament
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>In the morning as I brushed my teeth<br>
I vowed to mark the day by valiant ways:<br>
To rescue orphans, open up a shop,<br>
Write that novel, win that maiden&rsquo;s heart,<br>
Climb that hill, convince a bitter friend<br>
Of God&rsquo;s wide mercy, till the soil, plant<br>
The choicest vegetables, grill meat<br>
Upon an open flame. In short,<br>
Engage in derring-do,<br>
And leave upon the earth a healthy brand.</p>
<p>Instead I shuffled off toward my job<br>
(leeching little life from radio&rsquo;s wiles),<br>
Sat in my cubicle, answered emails,<br>
Took calls, called shots, most of which were small,<br>
Mundane, of little consequence. And while<br>
I always tried to do my best, at end<br>
Of day I&rsquo;d lost so much to waste,<br>
My puny fight &lsquo;gainst entropy unwon,<br>
And still to lose. I shuffled home, then<br>
Microwaved some food, watched video,<br>
Paid homage to the goods that fence me in<br>
And hinder me from seeing the sublime<br>
In humble living, mastery of self,<br>
Right conduct, purity of heart,<br>
And noble deed. Indulged on, fat<br>
And restless, I hied myself to bed<br>
So I could rest to do it all again,<br>
And leave yet more undone.</p></p>

        Announcing ihopesolution.com
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>So a <a href="https://hoobajoobfaq.org">sysadmin friend</a> and I decided that there just
weren&rsquo;t enough blogs about systems administration and linux out there. So we
started another one:</p>
<p><a href="https://ihopesolution.com">ihopesolution.com</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will develop its own voice, since we both have, um, firmly held
opinions about how things should be done. And odd senses of humor.</p>
<p>Since I tend to use emacs more for writing and org-mode rather than
sysadminning, I&rsquo;ll keep my emacs posts for my personal blog. (And so ends my
feeble attempt to justify tagging this &ldquo;emacs&rdquo; and watching it hit planet
emacsen.)</p></p>
