      <description>&lt;p&gt;Allen Ginsberg sang the slow poetry of the technological age before its time.&#xA;He took the time to wallow in the horrors of the banal that flit by us as fast&#xA;as we can click thru. With Whitman as his muse, he turned our eyes from nature&#xA;to our fractured nature, and held our gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even especially like Ginsberg&amp;rsquo;s poetry. Give me Hopkins any day. But&#xA;the torrent of measured fitfulness poured out as a fruitless libation, sterile&#xA;poetry stank with death, demise, burrowing in little rat holes for faint hope;&#xA;well there&amp;rsquo;s more &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; there than the internet, right? A goodly bit of the&#xA;tubes piping bare flesh into bare hands and barren hearts, the rest amalgams&#xA;of news, quizzes, pokes, wanton squealing over shiny things, and poor people&#xA;mortgaging themselves on the next turn-key SEO keyword whitepaper build an&#xA;audience dropship four hour solution (run on index cards, of all things). Well&#xA;of course Ginsberg&amp;rsquo;s deadbeat doped out strung hipster buds and their very&#xA;real suffering has more life than that. Life takes time. Poetry takes time.&#xA;The tubes steal attention, the grist of living. Time bandits. Attention&#xA;pirates. Design masquerading as art. The shocking parading as feeling. This&#xA;pause pretending to be an ending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
