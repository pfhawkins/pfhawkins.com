      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started using Emacs, I had grandiose notions of producing copious&#xA;amounts of prose, linking it together in all sorts of interesting and helpful&#xA;ways, and basically revolutionizing the way I experienced computers. But most&#xA;of all, I had a new and urgent desire to do everything from the keyboard in a&#xA;blazingly efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I proceeded to burn the Emacs keybindings into my brain and fingers. I&#xA;developed some slightly inefficient workflows (copying and pasting from text&#xA;documents into OpenOffice documents, editing the original text file based on&#xA;whatever page length I was going for, rinse and repeat until paper is&#xA;produced) that were, on the whole, a net gain due to the speed of typing&#xA;without mousing. The linux filesystem positively danced under my fingertips. I&#xA;had more control over my system than I had ever had on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
