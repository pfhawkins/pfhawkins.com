        IN WHICH I Stump for Vi
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>At the mundane little sysadmin blog I contribute to, I wrote a little piece
explaining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091202043219/http://ihopesolution.com/2009/08/emacs-vs-vi-keybindings">why you need to know vi
keybindings.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you emacsheads will love it.</p></p>

        Announcing ihopesolution.com
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>So a <a href="https://hoobajoobfaq.org">sysadmin friend</a> and I decided that there just
weren&rsquo;t enough blogs about systems administration and linux out there. So we
started another one:</p>
<p><a href="https://ihopesolution.com">ihopesolution.com</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will develop its own voice, since we both have, um, firmly held
opinions about how things should be done. And odd senses of humor.</p>
<p>Since I tend to use emacs more for writing and org-mode rather than
sysadminning, I&rsquo;ll keep my emacs posts for my personal blog. (And so ends my
feeble attempt to justify tagging this &ldquo;emacs&rdquo; and watching it hit planet
emacsen.)</p></p>

        On Finding a Document Production Workflow for Emacs
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>I have a modest goal: write some fiction. Instead of actually working toward
accomplishing that goal, I&rsquo;m going to obsess about the toolchain and other
externalities used to support this endeavor.</p>
<p>I will use revision control. By an accident of history I will be using git.</p>
<p>I will use a text editor. Since I don&rsquo;t want to have to run into frictions
from modal editing while fiction writing, I will be using Emacs.</p></p>

        How I Use Emacs
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>When I started using Emacs, I had grandiose notions of producing copious
amounts of prose, linking it together in all sorts of interesting and helpful
ways, and basically revolutionizing the way I experienced computers. But most
of all, I had a new and urgent desire to do everything from the keyboard in a
blazingly efficient manner.</p>
<p>I proceeded to burn the Emacs keybindings into my brain and fingers. I
developed some slightly inefficient workflows (copying and pasting from text
documents into OpenOffice documents, editing the original text file based on
whatever page length I was going for, rinse and repeat until paper is
produced) that were, on the whole, a net gain due to the speed of typing
without mousing. The linux filesystem positively danced under my fingertips. I
had more control over my system than I had ever had on Windows.</p></p>

        How I Came to Love Emacs
      </a>
      <p class="f5 f4-ns"><p>This is the story of a man and his favorite text editor.</p>
<p>In 2001, I was a freshman in college, which meant the closest thing to
highspeed internet that I had hitherto experienced. Which upped my time
surfing the web. One of the delightful sites I lighted upon was
<a href="https://ftrain.com">Ftrain.</a></p>
<p>One day, I dug through Ftrain&rsquo;s archives and found <a href="https://ftrain.com/util_emacs_hints.html">Emacs
Notepad</a>. I was intrigued. Having
exclusively used Word (and Notepad to edit HTML - ha!) up until that point,
this Emacs thingy sounded fascinating. I downloaded a Windows version right
away.</p></p>
