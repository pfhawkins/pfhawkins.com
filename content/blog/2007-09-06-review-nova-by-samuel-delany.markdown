[Nova](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375706704?ie=UTF8&tag=phawkcom-20&lin
kCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0375706704)![](http://www
.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=phawkcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0375706704) is a gem of a
novel. If you can get past one huge _faux pas_, any sf buff with half a brain
should find something to enjoy in this book.

_Nova_ is primarily a space opera. If you don't like space opera, don't worry,
the book is more than just space opera. It is a thoughtful extrapolation of
the future (well, except for the _faux pas_), as well as a philosophical mind-
twister. But it is primarily a space opera.

Lorq Von Ray assembles a rag-tag crew to hunt the hitherto scarce source of
power in a nova, all the while trying to beat his childhood enemies at the
same game. Shakespearean intrigue of mythical proportions plows straight into
a well-conceived action-adventure. With gorgeous prose. What's not to like?

If you are one of those people who thoroughly dislikes new age quackery, such
as the tarot, it will take a large suspension of disbelief to overcome the
_faux pas_ of making the tarot a scientific method of guiding the characters'
lives (as if!). But if that hurdle can be got over, _Nova_ is well worth it.
