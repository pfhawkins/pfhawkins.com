Welcome to pfhawkins.com!

My name is P.F. Hawkins. I have a first name and a middle name of which I am
not ashamed (unlike Clive Staples Lewis or Pelham Grenville Wodehouse), but my
first name/last name combination was not available as a domain name, so I
thought I would imitate them in using my first two initials.

I haven't decided whether or not I am going to use this site as a serious,
work-related sort of site for freelancing (I might start copywriting on the
side), or if I'm going to ignore all that and go with my life-long dream of
becoming a published novelist. Probably the latter. Hopefully after doing this
for a few months, the site will take on a life of its own. But in the
meantime, feel free to stick around and watch me thrash about whilst I find my
voice.
