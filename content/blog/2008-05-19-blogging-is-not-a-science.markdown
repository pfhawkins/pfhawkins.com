There is something about data that recommends itself. The more data you have
the more you ostensibly know about the subject; the more you know the better
basis you have for your decisions; the better foundation for your decisions
the higher the odds your decisions are the right ones. Everyone likes to make
the right decisions. Few things are as truly satisfying.

That said, most data are crap. If they're not inaccurate then they draw your
focus to the wrong thing. Instead of basing your decisions on what it is
you're actually doing, you're basing them on a reading of the effects they had
the last time you did them.

The above is exemplified in web statistics. Say, for example, that you start
blogging. You're shouting into the void on a regular basis, and then BAM!
[someone links](https://sachachua.com/wp/2007/10/12/how-i-came-to-love-emacs/)
to [one of your pieces](/2007/10/10/how-i-came-to-love-emacs/), and you watch your stats shoot up. The tempting thing to do is write
a [similar piece](/2007/10/15/how-i-use-emacs/) on the
same topic. AND YOU WOULD BE WRONG.

What worked the first time? Writing something you wanted to write for the sake
of writing it. The second time, your ulterior, utilitarian motives will work
against you.

I was spurred to write this by [this
tweet](https://twitter.com/al3x/statuses/812166550), with which I completely
agree. On the one hand, blogging is a conversation. On the other, it is
shouting into the void. There are no guarantees that anyone will click your
way, or read what you've written once they get there. And if [that's your
focus](https://twitter.com/ronaldlewis/statuses/310321802), well, maybe you'll
get the links, but you'll have sold out. I'm not condemning selling out, it
has its time and place, but there is a reason people sneer when they say "he
sold out".

I'm putting my money where my mouth is: goodbye Google Analytics. Goodbye
data. If you need me, [email works best](/contact/).
