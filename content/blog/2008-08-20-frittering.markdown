I fritter away a lot of time. This bothers. I have a stack or two of notecards

tasks to fill my time. I don't exert my will over this time like I ought.

completed.

I have, in my stack of notecards, a couple tasks that cannot be broken down
into any further smaller, more manageable chunks. They start with words like
"Research" and "Draft". I usually just work on the ones starting with "call",
"reply", and "check" instead.

If I had an accurate brand, my logo would be of a slowly-leaking tire, doing
most things right, but heading for reinflation or replacement.
