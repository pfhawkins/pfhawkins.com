So a [sysadmin friend](http://hoobajoobfaq.org) and I decided that there just
weren't enough blogs about systems administration and linux out there. So we
started another one:

[ihopesolution.com](http://ihopesolution.com)

I'm sure it will develop its own voice, since we both have, um, firmly held
opinions about how things should be done. And odd senses of humor.

Since I tend to use emacs more for writing and org-mode rather than
sysadminning, I'll keep my emacs posts for my personal blog. (And so ends my
feeble attempt to justify tagging this "emacs" and watching it hit planet
emacsen.)
