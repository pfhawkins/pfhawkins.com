The only to write well is to write often and get the kinks out. I don't write
well yet. Therefore, expect to see a fair deal of suckage in this space before
you start to see amazing prose of stunning brilliance. (And then, thank God
that you're only seeing a fraction of what I'm actually writing).

You have been warned.
