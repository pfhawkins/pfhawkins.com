"You're too funny."

"Why? What did I do?"

She was laughing too hard to be taken aback. "What do you mean?" Snort.

"If I was _too_ funny, then I wasn't _just the right amount_ of funny. When
did I cross the line?"

Her hysterics subsided. "I'm not sure." She instinctively reached for his
hand.

"I simply showed you the comic, which I thought was simply funny, and then
reiterated that I like the man in the last panel would be thinking about how
the bear might defend himself from..."

She interrupted. "Don't, you'll kill it," she said, her face drawing down into
a pout.

"But I thought I did kill it; I went too far." He very nearly looked her full
in the face.

"Now you have." She actively avoided his stare.

"So I hadn't before?"

"I was laughing my fool head off!"

"But you said I was _too_ funny."

"God!" she blasphemed loudly enough for other passengers to hear. "Did you not
catch the emphasis you just repeated back to me? You're too funny doesn't mean
you're _excessively_ funny, just that I find you _very_ funny." She lightly
punched him in the should; he was oblivious to it. He was too busy thinking.

"Oh," he said after a while. "I think I blew it."

"Yes." She was looking straight ahead. "Yes you did."

"I suppose now isn't the time to talk about marriage then."

"I suppose not," she said. "I thought we were going to have a nice discussion
about it."

"On a bus? Because I showed you a comic strip?"

"Why on earth must you always do this?"

"Do what?"

"One minute you're hilarious and then you're still huggable but then you're
still so serious about everything it just... you eat moments like zombies eat
brains."

"Unthinkingly?"

She burst out laughing and whacked his chest with her purse.
