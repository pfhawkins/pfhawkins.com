Darksomeness engulfs  
Low fallow fields left  
Firm as rock dried in sun,  
Cold as crisp iceberg submerged.

Submariners stumble on  
Unseen fissues, folds,  
Crevasses, barren blisters  
Of lifeless locked land.

Passengers punched their tickets,  
Paid their fares, folded  
Clothes, packed bags, braved  
Jet lag just to be here.

Groping in obsidian night, all  
Rend asunder suddenly, then  
Rend again, rend again,  
Ever tearing never ending

Souls unbending, breaking o'er  
And o'er again in pain  
Unmending, sending lame  
Desires (unquenched fires) drowning.

Powdered blood evaporates  
In self-blind souls enslaved in state  
Of everlasting fruitless wait.
