I saw the best minds of mah generation
Hurtling down the intertubes
Captioning photos of felines in bold sans serif
cuteness aplenty, lolling all over myself
Eager to disprove or win by force your momma, mah bukkit, bukkake
Full of fail

Let us read [this treatise on the death star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU), how it is like unto a womb.

THIS POEM HAS BEEN RICK-ROLLED

I could bury you with a staggering
inventory of despicable instaculture
Perpetuated by the hypothalamus kickstart
Suns out, reboot Mountain Dew Ganja

Lost it

Tweakin' mah Javascript
NOT THINKING ABOUT REAL THINGS

I want Obama in my ovaries

Serious Poem Are Serious

Every utterance a reference
Irony is the cultural coin
There are no competing currencies
That's not a sustainable business model
