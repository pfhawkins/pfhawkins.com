The wordsmithy raided the vowel-shed  
For a round "O" to hold up surrounding consonants.  
In the smithy he realized that alone it could not hold the "R" and "T" together,  
But he always kept a few "E" at the workbench.  

In two short decades he found his job obsoleted by script kiddies crawling the fourth channel,  
RSI brain cramps birthing automated skynet.
