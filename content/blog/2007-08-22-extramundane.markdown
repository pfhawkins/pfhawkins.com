I was going through [The Word Museum: The Most Remarkable English Words Ever Forgotten](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684857618?ie=UTF8&tag=phawkcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0684857618) and I found this
complete gem of a word:

> Extramundane: the infinite empty space, which is by some supposed to be
extended beyond the bounds of the universe, and in which there is nothing at
all.

That is very near what I would call a perfect word. As is this other one I
found:

> Stellascript: That which is written in the stars.

I want to write stellascript when I grow up.
