Black twisted gnarled gristle  
Lawn dance and howl whistle  
Spew out the fire bile  
Hate-wracked the whole while  
Teeth gnawing blood-glistened  
No time to love-listen.  
Can't rue the damned day  
Eternity's the same way  
Dance down the death-glade  
Empty with heart spayed.  
What's left is tied taut;  
Pain fills the no-thought.  
What was the self thing,  
Clutched, did this hell bring?
